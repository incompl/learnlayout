h2. How to Translate

Translation files live in the "translations":https://github.com/incompl/csslayoutsite/tree/master/translations directory. Each file is a "2-letter ISO 639-1 language code":http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php and the YAML file extention.

If you're not familiar with YAML, it's a very simple human-readable data format. Each line contains a translation code, a colon, and a value in quotes. The translation codes are the same in every language, and the actual translation on the right is in the appropriate language for the file.

To contribute to a translation, start with "en.yaml":https://github.com/incompl/csslayoutsite/blob/master/translations/en.yaml and either "email me":mailto:gsmith@incompl.com translated YAML files or make pull requests against this repository if you know how.

To test a translation, change the @lang@ property in "_config.yml":https://github.com/incompl/csslayoutsite/blob/master/templates/_config.yml before you build. If you choose an RTL language you need to add the line @rtl: true@ to the config.
